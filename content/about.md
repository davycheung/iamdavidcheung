Senior developer building and maintaining useful things through generous amounts of 🤔🤔🤔 and ☕️☕️☕️!!!



Currently accruing an awesome amount of experience in [laravel](https://www.laravel.com/), doing daily migrations, defining eloquent models, custom artisan commands, front end development with blade templates & [Vue](https://www.vuejs.com/) components.


When not working you can find me at a [NodeJS Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/nodejs/), [hiking](http://hikethehudsonvalley.com/breakneck-ridge/), and otherwise enjoying life (✈️,🍻, 🍽).
